# ddcpuid, CPUID tool

ddcpuid is a simple and fast x86 processor information tool, works best with Intel and AMD processors where features are documentated.

I will gladly implement features from VIA, Zhaoxin, and others once I get documentation.

The ddcpuid User Manual is available [online](https://dd86k.space/docs/ddcpuid-manual.pdf) (PDF).

# Compiling

It is highly recommended to use the `-betterC` switch when compiling.

DMD, GDC, and LDC compilers are supported.

## GDC Notes

GDC support is still experimental. **Compiling above -O1 segfaults at run-time.**

## LDC 1.13.0+ on Windows

Since LDC 1.13.0 includes lld-link on Windows platforms, the project may fail to link. Using the older linker from Microsoft will likely fail as well. No work-arounds has been found up to this date other than using LDC 1.12.x.
