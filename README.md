## A CPUID tool

This small utility will reveal everything through the `CPUID` instruction without any library or third-party help. 

If you have any questions, suggestions, requests, find any bugs, or notice incorect data, please either start an Issue or send an [email](mailto:devddstuff@gmail.com)!

THIS TOOL IS ONLY FOR x86 AND x86-64 (AMD64) BASED PROCESSORS.

Other architectures may become supported in the future.
