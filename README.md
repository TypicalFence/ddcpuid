# ddcpuid, CPUID tool

ddcpuid is a simple x86/x86-64 CPUID information tool, works best with Intel and AMD processors where features are documentated.

I will gladly implement features from VIA, Zhaoxin, and others once I get documentation.

The ddcpuid User Manual is available [online](https://dd86k.space/pub/ddcpuid-manual.pdf) (PDF).

## Bugs

ddcpuid isn't perfect. For any misleading or incorrect pieces of information, please make an Issue or email me (email's on my profile). 

## Compiling
