# ddcpuid, A CPUID tool

![Screenshot of ddcpuid](https://dd86k.github.io/imgs/ddcpuid3.png)

This small utility will reveal everything through the CPUID instruction without any library or third-party help. 

THIS TOOL IS ONLY FOR x86 AND x86-64 (AMD64) BASED PROCESSORS.

Other architectures may become supported in the future.

## Compiling

The source uses the standard asm statements (ala MSVC) which is not compatible with GDC (GNU D Compiler).

Otherwise, this compiles normally on any x86-based processors.

## Contributing
Any help is appreciated! I recommend reading the Intel and AMD reference programming guides and verifying your information before suggesting a fix.
