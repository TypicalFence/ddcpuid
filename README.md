# ddcpuid, CPUID tool

ddcpuid is a simple x86/x86-64 CPUID tool, works best with Intel and AMD processors.

I will gladly implement features from VIA, Zhaoxin, and others once I get documentation.

A ddcpuid User Manual is available [here](https://dd86k.github.io/docs/ddcpuid-manual.pdf).

## Bugs

ddcpuid isn't perfect. For any misleading or incorrect pieces of information, please report to this repository or via my email (on my profile). 

## Compiling

It is recommended to use the `-betterC` switch when compiling.
